### Background


### Instructions:

### Important Files:
1. data
`data/process_data.py`: The ETL pipeline used to process data in preparation for ML model building.

- input
    - .csv: dataset including all the categories
- output
    - .db: output of the ETL pipeline containing *** data

2. model
`***.py`: The Machine Learning pipeline used to fit, evaluate, and save the model to a Python pickle file (pickle is not uploaded to the Github due to size constraints.).

- input:
- output:

### Results
1. An ETL pipleline was built to read data, clean data, and save data into a dataframe.
2. A ML pipepline was developed to train a classifier to performs *** classification.
